# Programmeren7

These are 3 assignments which where made for a programming course at the University of Applied Sciences Rotterdam.
These assignments were written in Haskell and the goal was to get a better understanding of functional programming.

## Requirements

To run the codes you need a GHC compiler which can be downloaded [here](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) if needed.
